# Oxbury Pathfind

Imagine representing a grid-shaped game map as a 2-dimensional array. Each value of this array is
boolean `true` or `false` representing whether that part of the map is passable (a floor) or blocked
(a wall).

Write a function that takes such a 2-dimensional array `A` and 2 vectors `P` and `Q`, with `0,0` being the top left corner of the map and returns the distance of the shortest path between those points, respecting the walls in the map.

eg. Given the map (where `.` is passable - `true`, and `#` is blocked - `false`)

```
. P . . .
. # # # .
. . . . .
. . Q . .
. . . . .
```

then `pathfind(A, P, Q)` should return `6`.

_Please avoid using libraries to implement the algorithmic side of this challenge, other libraries (such as PHPUnit or Jest for testing) are welcome._

### What I'm Pleased With

I was able to implement the search on the 2d array for a shortest path based on my understanding between two given vectors.
Followed the algorithm similar to Astar. Tried my best.


### What I Would Have Done With More Time

Would have made use of the vector libraries and tried a reverse search to cover all parts or more accessors.
